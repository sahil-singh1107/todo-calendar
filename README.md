Task Management App
This is a simple Task Management App built using React and Chakra UI. The app allows users to select a date, add tasks for that specific day, mark tasks as complete, and delete tasks. The tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, so they persist across page reloads.

Task Deletion: Delete tasks when they are no longer needed.
Date Selection: A calendar allows users to pick a date to add tasks for that day.
Local Storage: Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage and persist even after refreshing the page.
Responsive UI: The app uses Chakra UI components for styling and responsiveness.
